\chapter{Experimental Environment}
\label{chapter.background} 
To familiarize the reader, this chapter describes the background of this thesis. 
This study includes software enhancements targeting asymetric multi-core systems.
Thus, we first give some background information about the asymetric multi-core architecture used in this work, which is the Arm big.LITTLE architecture~\cite{Greenhalgh2011}.
The second part of this chapter, provides information about the parallel programming models, that is the currently used method for parallel programming in HPC applications.
Finally we we provide a high-level description of the applications used in this work.
